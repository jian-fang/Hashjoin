# myHashjoin

This project is modified from the project "Parallel Joins on Multi-Core" by Cagri Balkesen et al. in the Systems Group at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Please find their project through https://www.systems.ethz.ch/node/334.

This project aims to explore the the law of how hash-jion works in modern processors, and give a guide for designnig a CPU+FPGA system to accerlerate the hash-join algorithms. This project can support large dataset (target on TB level), various tuple size
